# MFCC_data
Logistic regressor and Neural Network analyzing Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coeficcients of Frog calls in UCI dataset

graph_data.py: 
- To run the model, simply run with no cmd-line args. Will automatically cycle through both files, printing all the relevant graphs and statistical information.

log_regressor.py:
- To run AND train, simply run with cmd arg ‘train’.  To skip training and load model in the zip folder, add ‘test’ to the cmd line arg.
 e.g. ‘python log_regressor.py test’

neural_network.py:
- To run AND train, simply run with cmd arg ‘train’.  To skip training and load model in the zip folder, use ‘test’ as a cmd line arg.
 e.g. ‘python neural_network.py test
